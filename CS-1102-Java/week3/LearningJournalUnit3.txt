In this week, I have learnt the basics of Java Programming Language as previous weeks, especially splitting the code into clear pieces and
arrays. I've found out that code splitting is one of the most important basic in the Programming Language. I read about DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
on some websites and when we try to split the reusable codes into subroutine (method), we don't have to re-write the duplicated code as we did before.
And it makes the developer to understand the code clearly by just reading it. By using this logic, we can avoid code duplication in our programs and
decrease the development time. If we are doing a team project, the subroutine (method) I created can be useful for other developers as well. My attitude
on learning programming language is still the same, I feel good to do things by coding. As a learner, I'm pretty sure that I'll keep learning and practising
programming language to solve almost everything I will face in my life. Moreover, I'm still trying to earn from doing these things, share my knowledge back to
those who will be new in programming as I am now. And I do want to appreciate everyone who gave this opportunity to learn these interesting IT subjects.
