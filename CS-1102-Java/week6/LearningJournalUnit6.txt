I've been learning the basic of Java Programming especially command based things. I this week I got a chance
to learn GUI programming using Java which is fascinating. I admit that I had to read the Paint program
very carefully unlike what we did in previous weeks. And I did some curious researches on Google and got
to know the GUI programming well. I feel like JavaFX is really strong enough to create GUI based applications.
It's components are something what make it better. And the Events and the way of registering Event Handler are
also important things in a JavaFX application since we need to take care of the actions of the user such as clicking,
dragging and typing in real-life applications. The UI components provided by JavaFX are really usable and we can
simply create our own layouts, components. That's my favourite features in JavaFX. For me, the challenging part for
the week6 is reading to understand the code of PaintProgram. But I could finally understand and imagine the flow of that
program successfully after taking couple of hours. I will make sure to increase my skills at Programming and create applications/
websites that will be useful and helping for the people. And as the last sentence of this Learning Journal, I would like to thank
to all, who founded this university, courses and provided these valuable materials to me.
