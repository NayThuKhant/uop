I think learning programming fundamentals using Java Programming Language is such a great idea. And since I'm really interested in this programming language,
doing assignment in this Language make me happy. I read the instructions carefully, tried to figure it out the tasks I had to do and followed the instructions to complete the tasks.
I did some googling to know about Java Programming Language more and collected the knowledge I got from Google and used them. And I was not looking for the tasks, I was just looking
for the solutions.

I was motivated to solve things on Java and really into it. To be honest, I didn't make any interactions rather than reading the book and googling. After doing the tasks, I believe
in myself more, and I'm pretty sure that the one I will be is a Software Engineer. I've learnt the composition of computer, working circle and some basics of Java Programming Language.
I wasn't sure that I can handle the tasks by using Java Programming Language or not at the first. But as soon as I have done it, I feel like motivated, and felt like it's not even a challenge to me.
It's like sharpening me to reach the height I want to. And I gained thd foundation of a computer and the basics of a program. And I know that this was just a first step to Java and
I need to learn it more, practice and become better. And I believe the concept of Programming Language makes me a better person in reality. I can decide what to do logically after leaning
the basics of Programming Fundamentals. And all I want to do now is to learn, collect and create things by using the knowledge I had and I will have. Moreover, I will involve in
open-source projects future, help people with the skills I have.
