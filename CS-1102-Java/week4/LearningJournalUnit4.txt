In this week, I have learnt about the knowledge of Class & Object which are essential basics of Object
Oriented Programming known as OOP. I think this kind of writing code can help us to better re-usability
and increase the clarity of a program for a human being. I read about the basic of Class & Object not only
from the book we have, but also from internet. And I tried to prepare my assignments as much as simple, understandable.
I simply tried to imagine class & object from programming as natural things we see around our environment and
with the help of that logic, I could understand that very easily. I'm still motivated more than enough to solve the
puzzle from the side of programming and I'm really happy to be learning these things.
