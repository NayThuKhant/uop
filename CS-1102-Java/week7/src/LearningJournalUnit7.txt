I this week, I got a chance to learn the things which are the basics of Java Programming Language.
To be specific, I learnt the following things.

- Array
- For each loops in Array
- ArrayList and The Wrapper Classes
- Two dimensional Array
- Autoboxing and Unboxing
- Arity functions and benefits

And I found out that Arrays are the important in every Programming Language. The basic of how a array works,
store the values are fascinating. And the Wrapper Classes are interesting as well because of theirs functions.
I was really motivated, happy and excited to learn those things in this week, and I'm sure that I'm still happy
while I'm writhing this Journal. But my previous Programming Languages are dynamic ones and I really needed to
take care of Static Things in Java, especially typed ones. But with the help of ebook we have, it went pretty
easier for me. And I'm really thankful for everything I can access here during this course, and I'll try my best
to improve my skills as a learner. And I will contribute everything I know once I'm ready just to help people
who are interested in IT field.
