In this week, I have reviewed especially about OOP in Java. And I have also tried to deeply understand the
inheritance and polymorphism in Java with the help of Quiz program we have made so far. I was so happy to
learn about it since I'm gaining the knowledge I need when I will work as a developer later on. But learning gap
wasn't too easy, to be honest. Anyway I managed to come over it, and finally I got the point of OOP after reading for
like couple of hours from the internet, and the pdf I have. I got help from the ebook and stackoverflow, javapoint to
overcome these difficulties, and I really appreciate to everyone who built or created these useful and helping platforms.
And I'm sure enough to contribute back once I'm ready to do it.I'll be learning Java more and more
to work as a Java Developer, and I will make sure to build things and help people with the things I have learnt from
this course.
