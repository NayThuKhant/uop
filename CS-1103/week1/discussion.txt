In computer programming, exceptions are runtime errors that occur when a program encounters an unexpected situation.
The question of who should be responsible for catching and handling exceptions is a matter of programming best practices
and the specific requirements of the application.

The general rule is that the computer program should be responsible for catching and handling exceptions. The reason
is that exceptions are part of the normal operation of a program and should be handled gracefully to ensure that
the program continues to run smoothly, even in the presence of errors.

In other words, exceptions are a way for the program to handle unexpected situations and prevent the program from crashing.
If a program crashes, it can cause data loss, damage to the user's system, or other unintended consequences.

I will provide the flow of handling an exception with the help of try catch below.

double x;
try {
    x = Double.parseDouble(str);
    System.out.println( "The number is " + x );
}catch ( NumberFormatException e ) {
    System.out.println( "Not a legal number." );
    x = Double.NaN;
}

In the above example, an error will be thrown due to the call of Double.parseDouble(str) where str is STRING TYPE VARIABLE.
Without catching this exception inside try catch, the program will end immediately. But As far as I understand, we should
not always catch the exception and let the program continues since it may lead to bigger problems sometimes.

In conclusion, only the computer program should be responsible for catching and handling exceptions.
