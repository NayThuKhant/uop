After learning Exceptions and Handling them deeply, I'm quiet excited to do everything to handle the exceptions, and do some rollback after an
catching an exception or alert the user from the prompt. Without that knowledge, I think we "programmers" wont be able to produce the sustainable
applications or websites. I can even imagine that the program will crash after every exception and that will not give the best application experience
to users and also in terms of losing Data. I'm really happy to get into this Language day by day, course by course. And I did learn about those
mechanism on Google, Stackoverflow and some articles related to improve handing the exceptions. And of course, these helped me a lot to understand better.
I'm really thankful to each of the writers who are willing to share their knowledge and experiences. I'm sure that I will share my knowledge like them
once I have enough experience in Programming.
