When designing a data structure in Java, it's important to choose the right collection to store
and manipulate your data efficiently. There are various types of collections available in Java,
each with its own strengths and weaknesses. So, it's essential to understand the characteristics
 of each collection to select the appropriate one.

Firstly, consider the size and type of data we will be working with. If we have a small amount of
 data and need to access it frequently, an ArrayList might be the best choice. ArrayLists provide
 fast access to elements by index, but can become slow when adding or removing elements frequently.

If we need a collection that maintains a sorted order, consider using a TreeSet or TreeMap. These
collections are implemented using a binary search tree, providing efficient searching and sorting of
elements. However, they are slower when adding or removing elements than an ArrayList.

If we have a large amount of data and need to perform operations like search, insertion, and deletion
frequently, consider using a HashMap or HashSet. These collections provide constant-time performance
for these operations on average, making them ideal for large datasets. However, they don't maintain
any order of elements.

If we need a collection that can maintain multiple values for a single key, consider using a Multimap
 from the Guava library or a Map that stores a Collection as its value. This is useful when we want
 to group elements based on a particular property.

Another important consideration is thread-safety. If we are working with multiple threads,
it's essential to choose a collection that provides thread-safe operations. For instance, a
Vector or a ConcurrentHashMap can be used in a multi-threaded environment. If we don't
require thread-safety, consider using a non-thread-safe collection like ArrayList or HashMap,
which can perform faster than their thread-safe counterparts.
